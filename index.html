                <p>Beku iBeacons are smart Bluetooth Low Energy devices that let you track locations indoors, trigger iOS and Android app notifications, open webpages specific to a physical location and more.</p>
                <p>Other beacons are designed with a fixed lifetime - they use a non-replaceable battery. Beku beacons are all designed with replaceable, rechargable batteries, or, with our USB beacons, no battery at all.</p>
                <p>They're also designed to be smart - managing other beacons requires physically walking around and using an app to change settings or update firmware. Beku beacons create a mesh network that allows them to communicate updates with each other with no need for you to be physically present. As long as one beacon has access to the internet (e.g a USB beacon installed in a computer) you can manage your installation remotely.</p>
                <p>If you're interested in our beacons, platform or fleet management system, have a chat with us: <a href="mailto:hello@beku.io">hello@beku.io</a></p>
